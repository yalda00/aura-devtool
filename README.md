# AURA — Speak Code, Ship Everywhere

> *Vibe coding to the max.*

**AURA** is a voice-first, AI-powered developer tool that lets you code anywhere, anytime, without touching your computer. By turning spoken intent into real code through a real-time audio pipeline, AURA removes friction from development and keeps you in flow — even when you’re away from your desk.

Built for developers who think better out loud, AURA enables hands-free coding, remote execution, and conversational feedback through a pure audio interface.

## 🚀 What AURA Does

- 🎙 Speak code into existence — no keyboard required  
- 📱 Code from your phone or any audio-enabled device  
- ⚡ Get real-time feedback through voice  
- 🧠 Focus on intent, not syntax  
- 🌍 Code anywhere while AI works in the background  

AURA lets you go about your day while your ideas turn into real, executable code.

## 🧠 The Problem

Modern development workflows constantly interrupt flow.

- Commands take time to run  
- Errors appear late and break momentum  
- Developers are tied to screens and desks  
- Creativity is lost when ideas happen away from a laptop  

Even so-called “vibe coding” today still involves too much waiting and sitting around.

## ✨ The Solution

AURA replaces screen-first development with a **voice-native workflow**.

Instead of typing commands or memorizing syntax, you talk. AURA listens, understands your intent using generative AI, applies code changes remotely, and responds with natural audio feedback — all in real time.

The result is faster iteration, fewer interruptions, and a more accessible way to build software.

## 🏗 How It Works

AURA is powered by a real-time, voice-driven system:

1. User speaks into the **SwiftUI mobile app**
2. Audio is streamed via **LiveKit**
3. Speech is transcribed using **Speech-to-Text**
4. **Generative AI (Gemini)** interprets intent and generates code
5. Code is applied remotely through AI-assisted tooling
6. Responses are converted back to speech using **ElevenLabs**
7. Audio feedback closes the loop in real time

This creates a fully conversational, hands-free coding experience.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **SwiftUI** — mobile UI  
- **LiveKit** — real-time audio streaming  
- **ElevenLabs** — text-to-speech  
- **Gemini API** — intent understanding & code generation  
- **Trae** — AI-native development environment  
- **Claude** — agentic coding support  
- **Node.js** — backend orchestration  
- **Ngrok** — secure tunneling for remote access

## 🏆 Accomplishments

- Built a fully working real-time voice → code pipeline  
- Achieved low-latency, conversational audio feedback  
- Enabled hands-free coding without a screen  
- Designed for productivity, creativity, and accessibility

## 📚 What We Learned

- Real-time audio systems are highly sensitive to latency  
- Voice-first interfaces must be designed around intent, not commands  
- Small interruptions have a huge impact on developer flow  
- Generative AI becomes far more powerful when paired with natural interaction  

---

## 🔮 What’s Next

- Deeper integration with autonomous coding agents  
- GitHub Copilot–style repo-level control  
- Hardware extensions (e.g. ESP32 earbuds) for device-free coding  
- Improved collaboration and context awareness
